# RouterPatchChecker
### By William Read
Router patch check, to determine if a router needs updating based of multiple criteria.

In order to use the application you will need to do the following:

1. Download and extract the repository.

2. Next open up a terminal window in the directory with the 'routerPatchChecker.py'.

3. Enter the command:
'''
python routerPatchChecker.py sample.csv 12
'''

This will then display all the results to the screen on routers that require a server patch.

## Notes:
The arguements that follow routerPatchChecker.py represent:
* CSV File Name --> enter the name of your csv document.
* Systems Version --> enter the version on which you filter through.
